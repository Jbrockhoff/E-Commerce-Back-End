## Description
This back end application allows a user (internet retail manager) to get, create, update, and delete inventory (by category,  product, and tag) using the Insomnia program. This will generate current and updated lists of a store's items available for purchase, the amount in stock, price, and attributes such as color and provide the retail company the ability to compete with other e-commerce companies.
